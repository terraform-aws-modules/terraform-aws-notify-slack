========================

Configuration in this directory creates an SNS topic that sends messages to a Slack channel.

Usage
=====

To run this example you need to execute:

```bash
$ terraform init
$ terraform plan
$ terraform apply
```

Note that this example may create resources which can cost money (AWS Elastic IP, for example). Run `terraform destroy` when you don't need these resources.
